# Spanish Wine Quality Dataset
Author: Peter Tran

## Source of Data

The dataset for this project was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset].

## Brief Description of Data

The dataset provides information about Spanish wines. It includes various features that describe the properties and characteristics of the wines.

## Target

The target variable in this dataset is the "rating" of the wines. The goal of this project is to predict the quality rating of Spanish wines based on the available features.

## What Does One Row Represent?

Each row in the dataset represents a specific wine sample from Spain. It includes information about the wine's attributes and characteristics.

## Classification or Regression Problem

This project is a regression problem. The objective is to predict the numerical rating of Spanish wines based on the provided features.

## Number of Features

The dataset consists of 10 features. These features include information about the winery, wine name, year, country, region, type, number of reviews, price, body, and acidity.

## Number of Rows

The dataset contains 7,500 rows, representing 7,500 wine samples from Spain.

## Challenges in Cleaning, Exploring, or Modeling the Dataset

While working with this dataset, the following challenges may be encountered:

- **Missing Values**: The dataset may contain missing values in some of the features, requiring appropriate imputation techniques.

- **Outliers**: Outliers in the data may need to be identified and addressed to prevent them from skewing the analysis and modeling results.

- **Data Quality**: It's important to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data, checking for any inconsistencies, errors, or noise.

- **Feature Engineering**: Additional feature engineering may be required to create more meaningful predictors for the wine quality prediction model.

- **Imbalanced Ratings**: The distribution of wine ratings may be imbalanced, requiring careful handling to ensure accurate model performance.

- **Model Selection**: Choosing the most suitable regression model(s) for predicting wine quality will be crucial, and various models may need to be evaluated and compared.

- **Interpretability**: Understanding the relationships between the wine features and the predicted ratings can be important for interpretability, and it may require further analysis and visualization.

Overall, these challenges will require thorough data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and thoughtful modeling techniques to develop an accurate wine quality prediction model.
